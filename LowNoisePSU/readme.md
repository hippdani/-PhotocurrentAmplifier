This folder contains all relevant information to build a small linear regulated and low pass filtered voltage source 
for the photocurrent sampling amplifier. The .zip folder contains everything needed to order the PCB at a manufacturer 
(like JLC PCB, which were successfully used in the past for this design). 

It is intended to connect to a cheap switch 
mode power supply using a barrel jack connector. Such power supplies are readily available but present a lot of 
switching noise on their output. This ciruit is very effective at attenuating the differential mode noise, 
however common mode noise is not addressed.
