This folder contains all the necessary information to order the photocurrent amplifier PCB from a PCB manufacturer. 
The eagle files were used successfully to order the PCB at [multi-cb](https://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/index.html), 
using the order details shown in this [Screenshot](https://github.com/hippdani/PhotocurrentAmplifier/multicbOrderSettings). 

The gerber files should be universally accepted by any PCB manufacturer.

The BOM contains parts for different configurations of the circuit, which ones are necessary for your build can be 
determined according to the information in [PCS_Doku](https://github.com/hippdani/PhotocurrentAmplifier/PCS_Docu.pdf). Alternatively, one of the precalculated configurations from 
the [QuickGuide](https://github.com/hippdani/PhotocurrentAmplifier/QuickGuide.pdf) can be used
